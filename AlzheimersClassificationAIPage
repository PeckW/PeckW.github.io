Development of a convolution neural network for the classification of Alzheimer’s Dementia.

Abstract:
Alzheimer’s and Dementia patients are increasing each year due to increased average age of living.
To help a greater amount of patients be diagnosed, a new neural network model will be created to classify stages of the Alzheimer’s Dementia.
Leading to earlier treatment and management of the diseases.
This study proposes the creation of a new neural network to be used for the classification of Alzheimer’s Dementia. 
The research creates a convolutional neural network for image classification using an Alzheimer’s data set containing pre-processed X-ray images.
The research provides documentation for the design, implementation and evaluation for the creation of a neural network using pyTorch version 1.9.0. 
A study of the neural network model ”StackNet” presents a validation accuracy of 0.65 when classifying Alzheimer’s Dementia.
Presenting an increased value of validation accuracy when compared to other models currently trained for image classification such as the base DenseNet model.
Through research of literature there is a lack of research when using X-ray data-sets, thus this model currently trained using X-ray imaging as a method of classifying Alzheimer’s disease.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
